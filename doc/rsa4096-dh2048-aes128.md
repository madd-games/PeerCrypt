Cipher Definition: RSA4096-DH2048-AES128
========================================

Cipher ID: `0x0001 RSA4096-DH2048-AES128`.

Signature scheme
----------------

The signature scheme is 4096-bit RSA.

### Key generation

1. Let *p* and *q* be two distinct, random, 2048-bit prime numbers.
2. Let *n* = *pq*.
3. Let *e* = *2<sup>16</sup> + 1* = *65537*; a prime number constant.
4. Let *k* = *Ï†(n)* = *(p-1)(q-1)*
5. Let *d* be the modular multiplicative inverse modulo *k*, i.e. *ed* mod *k* = *1*.
6. *d* and *n* must be stored as the key. The public key is *n* on its own, while the whole pair is the private key. Both values are 4096-bit.

### Key file

The [key file](keyfile.md) format specific to this cipher is as follows (all fields in big endian):

|RSA4096-DH2048-AES128 Key File                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Magic number (32 bits). The string `KEY\0`. Used simply to identify this as a key file.|
|16-bit [cipher ID](cipher.md), `0x0001`.                                               |
|The 4096-bit value of *n*.                                                             |
|The 4096-bit value of *d*.                                                             |
|*There must be no more data in the file.*                                              |

### Public key string
The scheme identifier is `RSA4096`, and hence the public key string has the format `RSA4096/key`, where `key` is the base64-encoded value of *n*, using the alphabet `0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ._`. The string *DOES NOT* have to be padded with zeroes.

### Signing

A signature for *m* is produced as follows:

*s* = *m*<sup>*d*</sup> mod *n*

### Signautre Verification

A signature is valid if the following equation holds:

*s*<sup>*e*</sup> mod *n* = *m*
